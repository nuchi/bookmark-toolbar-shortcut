# Bookmark Toolbar Shortcuts

Up until Firefox 57 I used [Jeff Balogh's Bookmark Shortcut Keys](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmark-shortcut-keys/). It's not compatible with Firefox Quantum, so I made my own version.

I use the option key, so that's hardcoded. I don't know of a way to let the user choose their own modifier.
